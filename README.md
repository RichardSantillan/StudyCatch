# StudyCatch

An Android study app that helps you study when you least expect it.
Nobody wants to study long sessions the night before, so lets prevent this by breaking your study into bursts, one question at a time.

## How it Works

This app is based off of your personal Quizlet sets. You are able to choose your favorite sets, based on the latest sets you've seen 
and set those as your current study sets.

One question from any of your current sets will appear as soon as you unlock your phone. Answer the question, then you will be 
shown the correct answer and the app will close. 

### Theory

Someone should be able to passively study 400 questions a week, based on the average of 1 question per phone unlock for 80 times per day a person unlock phones for 5 business days.

### Goal

* Make this app flexible and personal to anyone's goals. 
  * Allow questions to not only show up on phone unlock, but in random intervals also/instead
  * Allow sets to be searched within the app
  * Allow for certain questions to be ignored and/or skipped
  * Allow users to set preferred study days
